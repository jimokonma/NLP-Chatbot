        <h2>Postgraduate Programmes</h2>
        <p>
            Our postgraduate programmes (M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph.D.) are first of their kind in Nigeria and the 
            response from prospective students has been remarkable. To date, our M.Sc. is one of the most 
            sought-after postgraduate degree programmes in the University.
        </p>
        <p>
            The postgraduate programme curriculum is being reviewed in order to conform with all aspects of 
            the new rules, regulations and policies of the Postgraduate School as well as ensuring alignment 
            with global best standards in terms of content and delivery practices. The review is also aimed 
            at making our graduates remain competitive in the labour market and relevant in the global 
            economy as well. Courses in the areas of supply chain management, computer software 
            development, robotics and entrepreneurship have been added to the new curriculum. 
            Consequently, the M.Sc. programme will be primed for the training of Engineers and Researchers 
            adequately equipped for demands of an increasingly competitive and highly globalised environment.

        <h2>PROGRAMME PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <p>
            The development and running of our programme are based on the philosophy that rapid 
            integration between academic studies and real-life applications in both the industry 
            and public service is what makes a good Engineering programme.  It is in following this 
            philosophy that, in all core courses of the proposed programme, students will be encouraged 
            to collect data and test Engineering models in real life situations.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The main objective is to prepare our students on how best to combine Engineering analytical 
            tools, computing and socio-economic principles for quality decision making and implementation 
            in complex Engineering management situations. 
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2%;">Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            The objectives of the MSc Industrial and Production Engineering Programme are to ensure 
            that students who pass through the programme will be adequately equipped with the 
            knowledge and orientation to:
        </p>
        <ol type="i" class="list-1">
            <li>Understand, appreciate and define the type 
                and scope of organizationâ€™s technological problems in industries and public service.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scientifically develop or adapt appropriate technological methodologies for solving these problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adopt managerial measures to effectively deal with safety, large 
                scale productivity, finance, organizational and other technology related management issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                To graduate Industrial and Production Engineers with sufficient computing, 
                communication and engineering management skills with the intent to enhance 
                their professional growth, career leadership and global competitiveness.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The Department currently runs three Postgraduate Academic (M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph.D.) 
            and one Professional Degree programmes:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-1" type="i">
            <li>Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Industrial and Production Engineering</li>
            <li>Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in Industrial and Production Engineering</li>
            <li>Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Industrial and Production Engineering</li>
            <li>Professional Master of Engineering Management (MEM)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The department produced the first set of graduates of M.Sc. in 1986, M.Phil. in 
            2013, MEM in 2014 and the first Ph.D. in 1989.
