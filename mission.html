                <h2>History of the Department</h2>
                <p>
                    The department was established in 1980 and the B.Sc. programme development commenced only in 1982 when the right
                     calibre of lecturers was recruited. It was designed by Industrial and Production Engineers with a
                      wealth of experience in academia and the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final draft incorporated all the comments and suggestions made by the stakeholders. 
                    In the 1983/84 session, the draft was approved by the Faculty Board of Technology and then 
                    by the University’s Senate. On its first visitation in 1988, COREN gave the programme full 
                    accreditation. On the repeat assessment in 1999, COREN again upheld its earlier decision. 
                    This decision was reaffirmed again in 2007 of subsequent years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first set of students for Part I were admitted in the 1984/1985 session. They graduated 
                    in the 1987/1988 resulting in a big rush by industry for immediate deployment in the NYSC 
                    programme. This validated an earlier judgement by COREN in 1984 that the “Industrial 
                    Engineering Degree Programme is vital to the Nigerian Industrial Development and should 
                    be encouraged” (Ref. COREN E/1/VOL. 3/2845/227).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its inception in 1980, the department was unique in being the first to teach Industrial Engineering concepts as service courses to the students of the Faculty of Technology. As a test of how vital to society some portions of the core courses were extracted and modified as Post experience short courses for practising engineers. Well over 1000 and 2000 participants from over 100 important companies in West Africa have benefited since 1983.
In 1990, the National Universities Commission (N.U.C) deemed it fit to rename the department: INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING. Since then the content of our B.Sc. had been modified, placing equal emphasis on Production as well as Industrial Engineering.
