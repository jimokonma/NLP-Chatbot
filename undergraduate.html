            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                The development and running of our programme are based on the philosophy that 
                rapid integration between academic studies and real-life applications in both 
                the industry and public service is what makes a good Engineering programme. It 
                is following this philosophy that, in all our core courses, students are encouraged 
                to collect data and test engineering models in real life situations. For the fact 
                that we are concerned with man-machine work systems, this has been very successfully 
                accomplished.

        <h3>Special Consideration (Waver Remarks)</h3>
        <p>One Arts subject is not the same as English Language which is compulsory for all candidates.</p>

        <h2>COURSE REQUIREMENT AND STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
            The students are introduced to the requisite mathematics, physics and social sciences in the first 
            two years. At the same time, the students are exposed to the concepts necessary to comprehend, 
            appreciate, design and analyse work systems and production processes later in the programme. 
            Thus, they take courses such as Workshop practice, Engineering Drawing, Mechanics and 
            Computer Programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the third year, students take general courses like applied Physics and Social Sciences 
            courses as Engineering Economics, Engineering Statistics, Operation Research, Materials 
            Science, Manufacturing Science, Work Study, Project Planning and Control, Machine tools, 
            etc. They also take courses like Strength of Materials, Applied Thermodynamics, Design
            of Machine elements and Mechanics of Machines, etc. which introduce them to the design processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the last two years, students take courses in which previously learned principles are applied 
            to design, analyse, operate and control effective and efficient work systems. These are done 
            either as laboratory/workshop exercises or in real-life situations. Such subjects include 
            Process Design, Facilities and Industrial Systems Design, Maintenance Engineering and Human 
            Factors Engineering. Others include Management Systems Design, Industrial Quality Control, 
            Tools/Fixtures Design, Robotics, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is mandatory for a student to spend a total of twelve (12) months outside of formal 
            studies for Industrial attachment. After the second and third years respectively, 
            students proceed on three (3) months Industrial attachment during the long vacation. 
            In the fourth year, the students are in the University for Formal Academic Work only 
            during the first semester. During the 2nd semester, the students are attached to the Industry 
            for Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) Training.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Production Engineering, 
            candidates must satisfy the regulations for the B.Sc. degree in the Faculty of Technology. 
            Candidates must also satisfy all departmental requirements. Candidates are expected to select 
            their courses in consultation with their course advisers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A student is expected to pass a minimum of 150 courses including all compulsory courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The details of the structure in terms of compulsory, required and elective 
            courses as well as number of units per level are presented in the table below:

        <h3>STUDENTS' INDUSTRIAL WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
        <p>
            There are three periods students are sent out for industrial experience at the end of successful 200, 300 and 
            400 levels. Associated with these periods are TIT 299 (2 units), TIT 399 (3 units) and TIT 499 (6 units) course 
            equivalents, respectively. While the first two are required the last one is compulsory. Students are therefore, 
            expected to submit a report and a work diary at the end of each training for evaluation. The Industrial Coordination 
            Centre of the University headed by highly qualified and vastly experienced director sources placements for students', supervises, 
            conducts seminars and effectively manages the programme. The members of the academic staff also pay regular site visits to ensure 
            that students are making the best use of the industrial training (IT). The student IT and seminars are graded by the academic 
            staff.
        </p>
        <h3>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>
        <p>
            The role of educational interventions in entrepreneurship development is now widely acknowledged in developing and sustaining 
            a growing national or global economy. It has been proved that entrepreneurs could be created through teaching, training and 
            counselling interventions as well. Entrepreneurship Development has thus become an important part of our system in the department. 
            Generally, all our courses have entrepreneurial flavours which are emphasised during interactions with the students. Also, the 
            TIE 526 (The Special Topics in Industrial Engineering) for the final year is used as platforms teach specific. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Entrepreneurial skills. Some of our Alumni who are successful entrepreneurs are brought in on regular basis to share their 
            experiences with and motivate our students. The department has a working memorandum of understanding with PEDI, Leyland 
            Automation Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, the university got a state-of-the-art automation centre donated by Nigeria Liquefied natural gas limited (NLNG). 
            This gas added great value to the students' practical experience. Our students also take the introduced entrepreneurial course run by the University's Centre for Entrepreneurship as a required course.
